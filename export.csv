IC.4.4.7	The TPS signals must be sent directly to the throttle controller using an analogue signal or via a digital data transmission bus such as CAN or FlexRay. Any failure of the TPSs or TPS wiring must be detectable by the controller and must be treated like implausibility.


IC.4.4.8	When an analogue signal is used, the TPSs will be considered to have failed when they achieve an open circuit or short circuit condition which generates a signal outside of the normal operating range, for example <0.5 V or >4.5 "

IC.4.4.9	When any kind of digital data transmission is used to transmit the TPS signal,
The FMEA study must contain a detailed description of all the potential failure modes that can occur, the strategy that is used to detect these failures and the tests that have been conducted to prove that the detection strategy works.

Teams must have a method to demonstrate that the actions in are met. System states displayed using calibration software must be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the control system.
